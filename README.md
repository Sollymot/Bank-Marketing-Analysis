# Business Recommendations
* Target marketing efforts towards customers aged 31-50 — they dominate call engagement, loan acquisitions, and show a strong financial footprint. Tailoring products for their needs can significantly lift conversion rates.
* Cellular (mobile) outreach proved far superior to landlines. Future campaigns should emphasize mobile strategies (e.g., SMS reminders, call scheduling) to optimize contact effectiveness.
* Customers with secondary and tertiary education levels showed higher financial involvement (loans, balances). Messaging should align with their lifestyle and aspirations to drive deeper engagement.
* May, July, and November were standout months for engagement. Planning intensive campaigns during these windows can maximize reach and effectiveness.
* Clients with multiple loans or histories of default should be segmented differently. By applying creditworthiness filters before campaigning, the bank can protect campaign ROI and avoid risky engagements.
* Married clients and individuals aged 31-50 are already heavily utilizing housing and personal loans. These groups present an ideal audience for cross-selling insurance, investment products, or premium accounts.
